# book-jukebox
a c++ application that works like a jukebox, but with books. The application has an admin and user part, each with different functionalities
the jukebox must be loaded by the admin with money and offers the rest to the customers. We have a series of tests for functionalities, and a series of validations and exceptions for money and books. I also used a template repo
